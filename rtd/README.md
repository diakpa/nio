Custom CGC Profile designs

## HTML/CSS 
Camgirl.Cloud allows registered members to add custom HTML markup to customize their bio
Options available are HTML and CSS boxes but HTML and inline CSS markup can be used

## Edit
- you'll need to add your customs and content, like images, links, buttons, texts

## Install
- HTML / copy the HTML markup and add it to HTML box
- CSS (skip this step if you are using HTML with inline css) / copy CSS markup and paste it into CSS box
- [full install instructions](https://diakpa.github.io/nio//rtd/)
